        bio: `
            Tobiah Goetz is the Executive Director of Elk's Software Development. With cumulative years of experience
            and companionable candor, it is no wonder that his leadership shines through. When not busy behind the
            desk or enterprising with other scholars, Toby can be found engaged in the snow sports community,
            enthusiastically recreating and overall-getting his hands dirty. After multiple successful
            high yield mergers/acquisitions under his belt and publications to his name, Toby believes that the
            only attempt that results in failure, is the one you don't take. He has been regarded as, "the
            pentacle of success while maintaining an altruistic community agenda at heart." -New York Times

            Jared Eller is the Elk's Chief Finacial Officer. Jared's history with software engineering is extensive

            impeccable attention to detail has continually driven the fundamentals of the Elk's business model.

            and triumphant. Overall, he is an outstanding member of this team and with his experience, the Elk's
            Software Development enterprises will continue to look prosperous for many years to come.
